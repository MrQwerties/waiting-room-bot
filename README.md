# waiting room bot

much code taken from [breakout room bot](https://github.com/HackyExtensionsForZoomMeetings/BreakoutRoomsBotForZoomMeetings)

## installation

1. [download the zip](https://github.com/cjquines/waiting-room-bot/archive/master.zip). unzip it somewhere.
2. open a new tab, type `chrome://extensions/` in the url.
3. turn developer mode on. (it's the switch in the upper-left.)
4. click load unpacked. select the "extension" folder that you unzipped.

if it worked, you should see "Waiting Room Bot for Zoom Meetings" be installed as a new extension.

## usage

1. join a zoom meeting using your browser. make sure you become cohost.
2. click the extension in your menu bar to open the popup.
  - if it's not there, you might have to click the puzzle piece, and *then* click the extension.
3. paste the list of names into the big textbox.
4. click "attach and launch"

if it worked, it should send an "active!" message to the chat. do not close the chat window. do not join audio. use another zoom client to actually participate in the meeting.
